					<p class="text-justify leading-tight line-clamp-[8] lg:line-clamp-6 mt-1.5 text-sm text-gray-600 font-light">External libraries are widely used to expedite software development, but like any software component, they are updated over time, introducing new features and deprecating or removing old ones. When a library introduces breaking changes, all its clients must be updated to avoid disruptions. This update, when it introduces a breaking change, is defined as a Breaking Dependency Update. Repairing such breakages is challenging and time-consuming because the error originates in the dependency, while the fix must be applied to the client codebase. Automatic Program Repair (APR) is a research area focused on developing techniques to repair code failures without human intervention. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), learning-based APR techniques have significantly improved in software repair tasks. However, their effectiveness on Breaking Dependency Updates remains unexplored. This thesis aims to investigate the efficacy of an LLM-based APR approach to Breaking Dependency Updates and to examine the impact of different components on the modelâ€™s performance and efficiency. The focus is on the API differences between the old and new versions of the dependency and a set of error-type specific repair strategies. Experiments conducted on a subset of BUMP, a new benchmark for Breaking Dependency Updates, with a strong focus on build failures, demonstrate that a naive approach to these client breakages is insufficient. Additional context from the dependency changes is necessary. Furthermore, error-type specific repair strategies are essential to repair some blocking failures that prevent the tool from completely repairing the projects. Finally, our research found that GPT-4, Gemini, and Llama exhibit similar efficacy levels but differ significantly in cost-efficiency, with GPT-4 having the highest cost per repaired failure among the tested models, almost 30 times higher than Gemini.</p>

					<p class="text-justify leading-tight line-clamp-[8] lg:line-clamp-6 mt-1.5 text-sm text-gray-600 font-light">We introduce Java-Class-Hijack, a novel software supply chain attack that enables an attacker to inject malicious code by crafting a class that shadows a legitimate class that is in the dependency tree. We describe the attack, provide a proof-of-concept demonstrating its feasibility, and replicate it in the German Corona-Warn-App server application. The proof-of-concept illustrates how a transitive dependency deep within the dependency tree can hijack a class from a direct dependency and entirely alter its behavior, posing a significant security risk to Java applications. The replication on the Corona-Warn-App demonstrates how compromising a small JSON validation library could result in a complete database takeover.</p>
